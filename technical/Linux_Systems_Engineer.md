## üìä Implementation Framework

### **The PENGUIN Linux Infrastructure Methodology**

**P - Plan & Provision with Automation**
- Define server roles, resource requirements (CPU, RAM, disk), and network topology
- Develop Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform or cloud-specific tools for provisioning
- Create base OS images (AMIs, golden images) with initial hardening and common tools
- Utilize configuration management (Ansible, Puppet, Chef) for consistent server setup and application deployment

**E - Enforce Security & System Hardening**
- Implement strong password policies, SSH key-based authentication, and disable root login
- Configure firewalls (iptables/nftables, firewalld) to allow only necessary traffic
- Apply security patches regularly and automate vulnerability scanning
- Implement Mandatory Access Control (SELinux/AppArmor) where appropriate
- Set up centralized logging (rsyslog, journald forwarding) for security auditing

**N - Network Configuration & Optimization**
- Configure static IP addresses, DNS resolution, and routing as needed
- Set up and manage network services (web servers, load balancers, VPNs)
- Optimize network performance (TCP tuning, interface bonding)
- Implement network monitoring to track bandwidth, latency, and packet loss

**G - Govern Services & System Processes**
