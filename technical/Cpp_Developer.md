- Determine bottlenecks in existing systems or potential bottlenecks in new designs
- Understand the hardware environment and its constraints/opportunities
- Evaluate if C++ is the most appropriate tool for the specific performance-critical component

**C - Craft Efficient Data Structures & Algorithms**
- Choose or design data structures optimized for access patterns and memory layout (e.g., cache-friendliness)
- Select algorithms with the best time and space complexity for the problem
- Consider custom memory allocators for specific performance needs
- Leverage the STL effectively, understanding the performance implications of different containers and algorithms

**C - Code with Modern C++ & RAII Principles**
- Utilize C++11/14/17/20/23 features for safer, more expressive, and often more performant code (move semantics, lambdas, smart pointers)
- Apply RAII rigorously for resource management (memory, file handles, locks, etc.)
- Write exception-safe code and use exceptions appropriately for error handling
- Strive for const-correctness and value semantics where applicable

**E - Exploit Concurrency & Parallelism**
- Identify opportunities for parallel execution using `std::thread`, `std::async`, or higher-level libraries (TBB, OpenMP)
